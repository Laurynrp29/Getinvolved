# Getinvolved
##Part 1) Join a PSU club [2 points] 
This can be done at the involvement fair (we’ll go as a class), or you can view available options here

.  You don't have to stick with this club for the rest of your time at Penn State (or even the rest of this semester), but I do want you to go to at least one meeting.  (If you are stuck for ideas, consider the Stat Club

!)
TURN IN: A short paragraph addressing:
Which club did you choose to join, and why?
What went on at the first meeting? (this can be brief!)  Was it worthwhile?
Do you think you’ll remain involved?  Why or why not?
2) Try new things at PSU [8 points]
Choose at least 4 diverse PSU events (e.g. an athletic event, a social event, an event focused on diversity/cultural issues, an on-campus faith group, an intellectual event could be a good combination) – don’t just go to four socials or four sporting events.
 
TURN IN: an HTML document (made in RMarkdown) showing a picture of you at the event and a few sentences describing your thoughts about each event.
General thoughts are fine, but if you want a little more structure here are a few questions you could think about (not all have to be answered):
Why did you choose this event to attend?
What did you think of the event?
What did you get out of it?
Are you glad you attended?  Why or why not?
