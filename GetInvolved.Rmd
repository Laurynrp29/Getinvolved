# Part 1) Join a club
##Which club did you choose to join, and why? What went on at the first meeting? (this can be brief!)  Was it worthwhile? Do you think youâ€™ll remain involved? Why or why not?
I chose to join the Statistics club because I am a statistics major. At the first meeting, we discussed what the club is about and different opportunities and insights the club will provide us. I do not think I will remain involved because I am in the Bells club and wish to join the actuarial science club.

# Part 2) Go to 4 diverse events 
##Turn in a document showing a picture of you at the event and a few sentences describing your thoughts about each event:Why did you choose this event to attend? What did you think of the event? What did you get out of it?Are you glad you attended?  Why or why not?
###1) The Bells
This is another club that I chose to join. One of the friends I had made on my dorm floor, offered for me to be an officer on the board for a new club she was starting. The club is officially approved and I am the website and social media manager for it. The picture shows one of the executive meetings. I am glad I joined and i attended so I can meet new people and get a chance to volunteer at homeless shelters.
